== Things to cover

[%step]
* What do we actually do?
* Is code everything?
* What about business?
* What about testers?
* What about operations?
* *This is not a _softskills_ talk*

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Deeper dive
** Documentation. Requirements, architecture / design documents, checklists, specifications
** Test data. Consumer driven contracts
** Operations. Infrastructure. Configurations. Database changes and migrations (sql / nosql).
* I'll tackle 3 areas: documentation, infrastructure, test data
** Tools and why people are resistance to it?

== What are we doing?

[data-background-image=images/i-have-no-clue.gif, data-background-size=cover, options="notitle"]
== I have no idea what I'm doing


////
Start with code - but there are other things in the project
* bunch of documentation (Didct) + changes (bring more copies)
* Content model (when tracking changes went wrong)
* GM CR migrations
* waiting for another developer to do their migration
* operations saying: I know you've written docs, but we don't read it (we just want you to write them)

You start understanding something went wrong
////

[data-background="#eee"]
== Documentation

////
* No diffs, changes not traceable
* totally outside developers workflow - developers are the biggers stakeholders
* versioning (in manual way), no blame and "lub czasopisma" not traceable
** photo z "content management"
////

== Who are docs written for?

* Products Owners
* Projects Managers / Team Leads
* *Developers*
* Analysts (?)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Documentation stakeholders & concerns
* Products Owner:  with how analysis maps to BR / FR. How tests covers BR / FR
* Architect: analysis changes and traceability (accessibility / readability)
* Project Manager / Team Leader: getting new people on board, how comprehensive are docs for the teams
* Developer: availability and comprehensiveness of documentation. Number of changes needed to be adjusted (number of required modifications)
--

////
Typical documentations silos
* dokumentacja_ydp.pdf
* http://philcalcado.com/2015/09/08/how_we_ended_up_with_microservices.html
////

[data-background="#eee"]
== Infrastructure

////
* handcrafted == error prone. 
** roll forward, hands off policy ==> job security. they gonna fire me
* bottle necks
** SVN do wdrożeń. too busy cutting the trees to sharpen an axe
** 100 maszyn, brak powtarzalności
////

[data-background="#eee"]
== Test data

////
* flyway migration tests (with docker, db instances)
* CDC test data
////

== Puenta?

[data-background-image=images/puenta-bubbles.gif, data-background-size=cover]
== OMG! We got tools!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* There are tools, but it's not about tools. Shift is the change of organisation
--

[data-background-image=images/puenta-crunch-walls.gif, data-background-size=cover]
== Crunch some walls!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Crunch some walls
** Architecture are principles. Design is code
** You code it, you deploy
** And get rid of the Enterprise Architect (Sparx one). It's neither enterprise nor architects - it's just a tool
--

[data-background-image=images/puenta-shigeru.gif, data-background-size=cover]
== Change the organisation?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Organisational change is an evolution. 
** I've shown some tools - an easy part
** Now the hard part - changing how people work
