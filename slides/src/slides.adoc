== What is *_code_*?

== Things to cover

[%step]
* What do we actually do?
* Is code everything?
* What about business?
* What about testers?
* What about operations?
* *This is not a _softskills_ talk*

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Deeper dive
** Documentation. Requirements, architecture / design documents, checklists, specifications
** Test data. Consumer driven contracts
** Operations. Infrastructure. Configurations. Database changes and migrations (sql / nosql).
* I'll tackle 3 areas: documentation, infrastructure, test data
** Tools and why people are resistance to it?

== What are we doing?

[data-background-image=images/i-have-no-clue.gif, data-background-size=cover, options="notitle"]
== I have no idea what I'm doing

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Start with code - but there are other things in the project

* bunch of documentation (Didactus) + changes (bring more copies)
* Content model (when tracking changes went wrong)
* GM CR migrations. I was DevOps before it was trendy
* waiting for another developer to do their migration
* operations saying: I know you've written docs, but we don't read it (we just want you to write them)
* testert driven development

You start understanding something went wrong

[data-background="#eee"]
== Let's talk documentation

== Tooling

[%step]
* Excel
* Enterprise architect
* Confluence
* Swagger (or other generated HTMLs)

[data-background-image=images/documentation-flow.png, data-background-size=cover, options="notitle"]
== How your documentation flow might look like

[NOTE.speaker]
--
An example information flow might look like - this is how it looks in one of a projects I participated in

== Soundcloud documents

.link:http://philcalcado.com/2015/09/08/how_we_ended_up_with_microservices.html[Soundcloud documentation]
image::documentation-soundcloud.png[caption="Example "]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
An example what is used within Soundcloud. 

Question is - who is the dcumentation for
--

== Who are docs for?

* Products Owners
* Projects Managers / Team Leads
* *Developers*
* Analysts (?)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Documentation stakeholders & concerns

* Products Owner:  with how analysis maps to BR / FR. How tests covers BR / FR
* Architect: analysis changes and traceability (accessibility / readability)
* Project Manager / Team Leader: getting new people on board, how comprehensive are docs for the teams
* Developer: availability and comprehensiveness of documentation. Number of changes needed to be adjusted (number of required modifications)
--

== So what's wrong?

////
* No diffs, changes not traceable
* totally outside developers workflow - developers are the biggers stakeholders
* versioning (in manual way), no blame and "lub czasopisma" not traceable
** photo z "content management" - z systemami gdzie rzeczy leżą informacje

== IEEE 1471

.Just building a wrong thing?

////
* what can we do about it?
* architecture vs design. 
** who here is having a role of solution architect?
** and what you actually do? design a system?
* architecture are principles (our API is self documenting), policies (we favour MySQL over Oracle), contexts (application landscape) - at the level of business requirements.
** they usually should not change unless project's business objectives change
** if they change - we are building a different system / product
* everything else is a design, it's an incremental process of building a solution
** you hardly ever know upfront the complete Container View from the C4 model
** what you design is heavily impacted by the feedback from the development team
** but still - we are keeping it in a different silo
////

////
* can we store the docs in git?
* have we make it approachable by an average developer?
* Try AsciiDoctor
** Write structured documents (not like Word - which can be structured but usually isn't)
** Include diagrams, flows - code snippets- and get a PDF within the buid process
////

project folder - springboot example
asciidoctor folder - manual

== Let's talk operations

////
* handcrafted == error prone. 
** roll forward, hands off policy ==> job security. they gonna fire me
* bottle necks
** SVN do wdrożeń. too busy cutting the trees to sharpen an axe
** 100 maszyn, brak powtarzalności
** Maciejewski - operations w facebooku
////

////
* We can try hipster - let's go Dockers.
** Docker within your build (conteinarize your build)
*** Dockerfile with your project
*** Dockerfile definition within pom.xml
** If not docker - puppetize stuff(manifests)
*** Puppet manifests - no client / server. To much hassle
////

////
Provisioning is not the only thing
* flyway migration tests (with docker, db instances)
////

[data-background="#eee"]
== Let's talk testers

////
* CDC test data

[data-background="#eee"]
== Puenta?

[data-background-image=images/puenta-bubbles.gif, data-background-size=cover]
== OMG! We got tools!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* There are tools, but it's not about tools. Shift is the change of organisation

[data-background-image=images/puenta-crunch-walls.gif, data-background-size=cover]
== Crunch some walls!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Crunch some walls
** Architecture are principles. Design is code
** You code it, you deploy
** And get rid of the Enterprise Architect (Sparx one). It's neither enterprise nor architects - it's just a tool
--

[data-background-image=images/puenta-shigeru.gif, data-background-size=cover]
== Change the organisation?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Organisational change is an evolution. 
** I've shown some tools - an easy part
** Now the hard part - changing how people work
