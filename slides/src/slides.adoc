== What is *_project_*?

== Things to cover

[%step]
* What do we actually do?
* Is code everything?
* What about business?
* What about operations?
* What about testers?
* *This is not a _softskills_ talk*

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Deeper dive
** Documentation. Requirements, architecture / design documents, checklists, specifications
** Operations. Infrastructure. Configurations. Database changes and migrations (sql / nosql).
** Testers
* I'll tackle 3 areas: documentation, infrastructure, test data
** Tools and why people are resistance to it?
* This is new stuff - feedback is appreciated

== What are we doing?

[data-background="#eee"]
== What are we doing?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Start with code - but there are other things in the project

* bunch of documentation (Didactus) + changes (even more documents)
* document without tracking - or tracing totaly unredeable
* tedious data migrations (through a far of "nearly identical" servers)
* waiting for another developer to do their migration (at 5am in the morning)
* operations saying: I know you've written docs, but we don't read it (we just want you to write them)

You start understanding something went wrong

An example what is used within Soundcloud. 

Question is - who is the dcumentation for
--

== Who are docs for?

* Products Owners
* Projects Managers / Team Leads
* *Developers*
* Analysts
* User Experience Designers
* Ops Guys

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Documentation stakeholders & concerns

* Products Owner:  with how analysis maps to BR / FR. How tests covers BR / FR
* Architect: analysis changes and traceability (accessibility / readability)
* Project Manager / Team Leader: getting new people on board, how comprehensive are docs for the teams
* Developer: availability and comprehensiveness of documentation. Number of changes needed to be adjusted (number of required modifications)
--

== So what is wrong?

[%notitle]
== Project documentation v0.1

image::documents1.png[]

[%notitle]
== Project documentation v0.3

image::documents2.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* new release - 30 pages less
* No diffs, changes not traceable
* totally outside developers workflow - developers are the biggers stakeholders
* versioning (in manual way), no blame and "lub czasopisma" not traceable 
--

[%notitle, data-background-image=images/documentation-flow.png, data-background-size=cover]
== How your documentation flow might look like

[NOTE.speaker]
--
An example information flow might look like - this is how it looks in one of a projects I participated in

* We spread documentation over multiple siloses, different systems
* One more example - simlar to the one previously. 
** We mapped system were project related data is stored. 
* This is not going in a good direction

We regard it as solution architecture. *The solution architecture*
--

[data-background="#fff"]
== IEEE 1471

.Just writing a wrong thing?
image::ieee1471.jpg[caption=""]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* As *solution architects* we focus on architecture description - creating docs (and that's how many understands modelling / architecture role) - *We tend to put too much there*
* Architecture is principles / statements (our API is self documenting), policies (we favour MySQL over Oracle), contexts (application landscape) - at the level of business requirements.
** they usually should not change unless project's business objectives change
** if they change - we are building a different system / product
* everything else is a design, it's an incremental process of building a solution
--

== Architecture vs. Design

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Design?
** you hardly ever know upfront the complete Container View from the C4 model
** what you design is heavily impacted by the feedback from the development team
** but still - we are keeping it in a different silo
* Often those closest to products (actually moving pixels/ cutting code) - have best ideas what the product should actually do
* How we can make the actual design be as close to developer's workflow as possible
--

== *Design as Code*?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* what can we do to have documentation follow same *git-flow*?
* ditch the docs
** make documentation accessible by developers, let them take ownership
* it starts with model, but quickly it's code that matters

== This is what we want to avoid

[%notitle, data-background-image=images/arch-vs-reality-ebCommunication2-cut.png, data-background="#fff", data-background-size=cover]
== As this how it looked in the original documents

== *Design as Code*

[%step]
*Entity*:: Application models _(Domain models - POJOs)_
*Control*:: Business processes / flows description _(Asciidoc)_
*Boundary*:: Endpoints definitions _(Swagger)_

[NOTE.speaker]

* That covers for most pervasive architectural pattern EBC: entity, boundary, controller (kudos go to @AdamBien)
* Only point more mysterious may by Asciidoc

== Swagger

[%notitle]
=== What is Swagger?

.A language-agnostic interface to REST APIs

Top-down:: use _editor_ and _codegen_ the server implementation
Bottom-up:: build documentation from existing REST API

[%notitle]
=== Swagger sample

[source, java]
....
@javax.ws.rs.GET
@javax.ws.rs.Path("/{id}")
@swagger.ApiOperation(
  value = "Get user", notes = "Returns the user of a given id with all subordinate objects.",
  response = UserPersistedDto.class)
@swagger.ApiResponses(value = { 
  @swagger.ApiResponse(code = 200, message = "OK"),
  @swagger.ApiResponse(code = 404, message = "User not found"),
  @swagger.ApiResponse(code = 400, message = "Bad request, user's id validation failed") })
public Response getUser(@NotEmpty 
  @swagger.ApiParam(value = "ID of user, that is stored in database") 
  @PathParam("id") Long id) {
    UserPersistedDto user = userMapper.mapPersisted(userService.get(id));
    return Response.ok().entity(user).build();
}
....

[%notitle]
=== YAML sample

[source, yaml]
....
swagger: "2.0"
info:
  version: "1.0"
  title: "Users API"
paths:
  /users/{id}:
    get:
      description: Returns the user of a given id with all subordinate objects.
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          type: string
          required: true
          description: ID of user, that is stored in database
      responses:
        200:
          description: OK
        404:
       	  description: User not found.
        400:
          description: Bad request, user's id validation failed.

Here's your first Java application.

.HelloWorld.java

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!"); <1>

<1> Prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

Compile this source to a class file using `javac`.
Then, run the compiled class file using `java`.

Asciidoctor is a lightweight markup

* headers, links, lists - obvious stuff
* Code snippets is first class citizen +
  With includes
* Diagrams (from ascii to image)

image::asciidoc-rendered.png[]

[data-background-image=images/done-part1.gif, data-background-size=cover]
== No more Word design docs!

[data-background="#eee"]
== Let's talk operations

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* I'll not cover deployments, instructions, checklists
** That's easy - asciidoc it and keep in project
* I'll focus on provisioning and changes in infrastructure
--

== Operations scope

[%step]
* Infrastructure 
* Application deployment
* Data migrations
* Monitoring

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* how it works with operations
** they have machines configured on their own
** they install application `svn up` 
** they migrate the data - if needed - with `db init`
--


== People per server ratio

[%step]
* On average: 1 per 200 - 500 machines
* In our company: 1 per 100 - 250 _(depends how counted)_
* Facebook: 1 per *25000* - https://hbr.org/2015/06/an-inside-look-at-facebooks-approach-to-automation-and-human-work[Source]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
That's expectation. You cannot adhere to it with

* handcrafted infrastructure == error prone. 
** job security. they gonna fire me
* bottle necks
** SVN do wdroÅ¼eÅ„. too busy cutting the trees to sharpen an axe
* configuration is code! 
** but just keeping bash in git doesn't solve the problem
** remember docs - same flow - git flow
--

== Set some principles

* Every delivery step is a *Jenkins* job
* Deployments are *roll-forward* only
* *Hands off* policy - not logging to servers

== Find the best tool for the job

* http://docker.io/[Docker]
* https://puppetlabs.com/[Puppet] or https://www.chef.io/[Chef] or http://www.ansible.com/[Ansible]
** with https://www.packer.io/[Packer.io]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Depending how hipster we are
* How much freedom we have
** What is overall maturity of the organisation / team
--

== With containers

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Docker package application and it's dependencies into a virtual container
** you put your app into container
** make all it's dependencies explicite

* plugin by Roland Huss for Maven
** but there is something for gradle as well
* let it run as a part of you CI process
** within a single project or independently
--

== Without containers

=== Packer

Dev/prod parity:: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
Enviroment from template:: Generate images for multiple platforms at the same time

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* From twelve factor app, to address
** time gap - like release once a year. *Great idea - if it's hard, make it rarely*
** personal gap - different ppl doing different things
** tools gap - different stacks for dev and ops (Nginx, SQLite, and OS X / Apache, MySQL, and Linux)
* Guess what - it's written in Golang
--

=== Packer templates

* *builders* - configure the image
* *post-processors* - clean up, save and compress the VM
* *provisioners* - scripts you run on your image

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* buider is actual VM configuration 
* provisioners are shell scripts you run after the configuration process on you environment (like `apt-get`)
--

[%notitle]
=== Packer templates example

[source, json]

{
  "builders": [
    {
      "disk_size": 40960,
      "guest_additions_path": "VBoxGuestAdditions_{{.Version}}.iso"

    }
  ],
  "post-processors": [
    {
      "output": "builds/{{user `box_basename`}}.{{.Provider}}.box",

  ],
  "variables": {
    "box_basename": "ubuntu-14.10",
    "template": "ubuntu-14.10-amd64",
  }
}
....

=== Use your fav provisioning tool

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* No holy war between ansible, puppet or chef
* Our workflow
** Pakcer install additional service fr provisioning
** Jenkins calls it (webservice) with env type parameter
*** It install java / vertx environment
** Jenkins call it with a service name
*** It deploys application
--

== Operations scope

* Infrastructure - icon:check-square-o[]
* Application deployment - icon:check-square-o[]
* Data migrations
* Monitoring

== Schema migrations with Flyway

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* as developers we have this tendency to abstract SQL
** it's first class citizen - accept it
* Flyway uses SQL as the primary languages (noXML)
* you hardly ever need to change database 
--

[%notitle]
=== How it works

[source]

â””â”€â”€ sql
 Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ V1__Create_person_table.sql
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ V2__Add_people.sql

Creating Metadata table: "PUBLIC"."schema_version"
Current version of schema "PUBLIC": << Empty Schema >>
Migrating schema "PUBLIC" to version 2
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "PUBLIC" (execution time 00:00.062s).
....

=== How it works in details

* creates *metadata table* _(SCHEMA_VERSION)_ - if doesn't exists
* applies migrations sorted by *version numer* and executed in *order*

== Let's talk testers

== What QA stands for?

[%step]
* Quality Assurance?
* Quality Analyst?
* Quality Ambassador?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* QA is not about checking / validating
** Testing is not checking
* If QA builds a process, awareness - checking should be automated
** If it's automated, make part of it human readable

== But it's all covered

* Test cases are code
* Test data is code
